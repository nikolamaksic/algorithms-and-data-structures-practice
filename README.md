# Algorithms-and-data-structures-practic
Algorithms-and-data-structures-practice is my personal repository for practicing and perfecting algorithm solutions. Here, you'll find a variety of problems from Leetcode, along with my solutions. This space is dedicated to continuous learning and skill improvement in the realm of algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to help you easily navigate different algorithm problems. Each problem is categorized by type and divided into individual directories containing the solution and test files.

### Directories by Problem Type:
Each problem type has its own directory, which contains subdirectories for each specific problem.

- `arrays/`
- `strings/`
- `linked_lists/`
- `trees/`
- `graphs/`
- `dynamic_programming/`
- `backtracking/`
- `others/`
